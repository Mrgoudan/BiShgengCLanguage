# BSC-Specific Diagnostics by Feature

This reference lists the diagnostics that BiSheng C adds on top of standard Clang, grouped by language feature.

Codes follow a `FEATURE-NNN` scheme: each feature numbers its errors independently starting from `001`; warnings use a `FEATURE-WNNN` series. Notes are not coded — they only appear attached to an error or warning, and are listed in the **Notes** column of the row that emits them.

## BOR — borrow (20 errors)

Every borrow-check error is emitted with one note from `BSCBorrowChecker.h::flushDiagnostics`. Confirmed against the source.

## MISC — declaration / dispatch consistency (7 errors)

Catch-all for small-count categories that don't merit their own feature: heterogeneous `_Safe`/`_Unsafe` declarations, struct member redeclaration, and overload-style dispatch failures. The heterogeneous-redecl error was split into four kind-specific diagnostics (return type / param type / param count / variadic) and the no-matching-function error was split by context (call vs. assignment), both pointing carets at the offending token.

| Code | Diagnostic | Message | Notes |
|------|------------|---------|-------|
| MISC-001 | err_bsc_generic_heterogeneous_redecl | generic function %0 cannot have both _Safe and _Unsafe declarations | — |
| MISC-002 | err_bsc_incompatible_heterogeneous_redecl_type | redeclaration of %0 has incompatible %select{parameter\|return}1 type %2 | `note_bsc_redecl_previous` — previous declaration had %select{parameter of type\|return type}0 %1 |
| MISC-003 | err_bsc_incompatible_heterogeneous_redecl_param_count | redeclaration of %0 takes %1 parameter%s1 instead of %2 | `note_previous_declaration` |
| MISC-004 | err_bsc_incompatible_heterogeneous_redecl_variadic | redeclaration of %0 %select{is not\|is}1 variadic, previous declaration %select{is\|is not}1 variadic | `note_previous_declaration` |
| MISC-005 | err_bsc_no_matching_heterogeneous_function_call | no matching declaration of %0 for call type %1 | `note_bsc_heterogeneous_candidate_arg_mismatch` — argument %0 of type %1 doesn't match parameter type %2; `note_bsc_heterogeneous_candidate_arg_count` — call passes %0 argument%s0 but candidate takes %1; `note_bsc_heterogeneous_candidate` — candidate declaration has type %0 (fallback); `note_bsc_heterogeneous_no_candidates_in_safe_zone` — no _Safe declaration of %0 is callable from this safe zone (emitted when every redecl is filtered out by the caller's safe-zone context) |
| MISC-006 | err_bsc_no_matching_heterogeneous_function_assign | no matching declaration of %0 for assignment to %1 | `note_bsc_heterogeneous_candidate`; `note_bsc_heterogeneous_no_candidates_in_safe_zone` (same fallback as MISC-005) |
| MISC-007 | err_struct_member_redeclared | struct member cannot be redeclared | — |

---

## SZONE — safe zone (12 errors)

| Code | Diagnostic | Message | Notes |
|------|------------|---------|-------|
| SZONE-001 | err_unsafe_action | %0 is forbidden in the safe zone | — |
| SZONE-002 | err_safe_zone_decl | `_Safe`/`_Unsafe` can only appear before on function or statement or parenthesized expression | — |
| SZONE-003 | err_union_member_access_in_safe_zone | access to union field is `_Unsafe` and requires `_Unsafe` block | — |
| SZONE-004 | err_safe_zone_case_in_nested_braces | `case` label inside a nested `{ }` in the safe zone | `note_safe_zone_case_in_nested_braces` — remove the nested `{ }`, or wrap the switch in `_Unsafe { ... }` |
| SZONE-005 | err_unsafe_cast | conversion from type %0 to %1 is forbidden in the safe zone | `note_inc_dec_void_in_safe_zone` — prefix/postfix `++`/`--` in safe zone produce void; use only for side effect (emitted when src is `void`); `note_unsafe_cast_non_trivial_pointee_type` — source pointee %0 is not a trivial data type (emitted for non-trivial `T* borrow → void* borrow`); `note_unsafe_cast_implicit_conversion` — source type %0 is implicit converted from type %1 |
| SZONE-006 | err_unsafe_implicit_cast | implicit conversion from type %0 to %1 is forbidden in the safe zone; please use explicit cast or other means instead | `note_unsafe_cast_implicit_conversion` |
| SZONE-007 | err_unsafe_fun_cast | conversion from type %0 to %1 is forbidden | `note_unsafe_to_safe_function_pointer` — assigning an unsafe function pointer to a safe function pointer type is not allowed |
| SZONE-008 | err_safe_function | %0 is forbidden in the `_Safe` function | — |
| SZONE-009 | err_safe_global_var | defining mutable global variables is not allowed within the safe zone | — |
| SZONE-010 | err_return_inc_dec_void_in_safe_zone | result of `++` or `--` cannot be used as return value in safe zone; move the increment/decrement out of the return statement (or add an explicit cast to `void` to suppress) | — |
| SZONE-011 | err_safe_string_init_too_long | too-long initializer-string for char array is forbidden in safe zone; array size %0 cannot hold string of length %1 (including null terminator) | `note_safe_string_init_too_long_hint` — adjust the length of the array or string, or wrap it with `_Unsafe` |
| SZONE-012 | err_safe_zone_ptr_arithmetic | use of `'++'`/`'--'` on raw pointer not supported in safe zone; consider wrap in `'_Unsafe { ... }'` | fires only for raw pointers (`_Owned`/`_Borrow` cases hit OWN-025 first); `note_bsc_ptr_declared_here` — pointer `%0` declared here (emitted when operand is a `DeclRefExpr`) |

`note_inc_dec_void_in_safe_zone` is also attached to several **non-BSC** Clang errors when the offending expression sits in a safe zone (`err_typecheck_subscript_not_integer`, `err_typecheck_convert_incompatible`, `err_typecheck_statement_requires_scalar`). Those parent diagnostics are out of scope for this table.

(`err_nonnull_init_by_default` is filed under **INIT** as `INIT-014`.)

Plus **22 BSC-specific notes**, each tied to one or more of the errors above (see the Notes column per row).

Out-of-scope BSC features (not coded here): traits, async/await, generic, constexpr, operator overload, instance member functions. These contribute several more errors, one warning (`warn_type_has_not_impl_trait`), and one note (`note_no_this_parameter`).
